So I was using the slot machine and I won the jackpot that is right I hit it big at the casino and now I am a very happy person . The people who worked at the casino then came and told me that I was not supposed to win and that I must have broken the slot machine . The casino then sued me for all of my money except I did not have any money because they took it all last time that they sued me .`;

data4=`For years our mission has been to make the worlds largest cat and we think that we have finally done it . We have never thought that we would be able to do this because we never had any money and we need money to buy food to expand the cat . We are finally happy about this because this is a huge innovation in the technological world and we are excited to have finally done this . We have hired a team of food feeders to feed the cat so that it will grow larger but our food feeders all quit so now our project is on hold but we are exited for it to resume again .`;
