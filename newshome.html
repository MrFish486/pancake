<h1>News!</h1>
<h2>So very new...</h2>
<p>My "news" project is generated by a Markov Chain, which is run on random sentences that I type in. Every version will have some edits from it's precursor, but all of them and trained on different data. Throughout the project, I will mostly just add more features, instead of taking anything away in the versions.
